    "que1- A crime is committed by one of two suspects, A and B. Initially, there is equal evidence against both of them. In further investigation at the crime scene, it is found that the guilty party had a blood type found in 10% of the population. Suspect A does match this blood type, whereas the blood type of Suspect B is unknown. (a) Given this new information, what is the probability that A is the guilty party? (b) Given this new information, what is the probability that Bâ€™s blood type matches that found at the crime scene?"
