    "ans1- No, it is not possible for an event to be independent of itself. The concept of independence in probability theory refers to the relationship between two or more events. If two events are independent, the occurrence or non-occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for events A and B to be independent, the following condition must hold: `P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)`\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider the event A to be the same as the event B, then we have `P(A ∩ A) = P(A) * P(A)`, which simplifies to `P(A) = P(A)^2`. The only way this equation can hold is if P(A) is either 0 or 1, which means the event A is either certain to happen or certain not to happen. In such cases, the event A is considered to be independent of itself, but this is not a meaningful or practical scenario in most situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the concept of independence is used to describe the relationship between distinct events, where the occurrence of one event does not provide any information about the occurrence of the other event."

    "Let A and B be two events defined as follows:\n",
    "- A: Tossing a fair coin and getting heads.\n",

    "\n",
    "But P(Ac ∩ Bc) = 0, as the event of getting tails in one coin toss (Ac) cannot simultaneously coincide with the event of getting heads in the other coin toss (Bc).\n",
