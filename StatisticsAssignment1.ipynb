    "ans1- **(a)** To find the probability that no one has the same seat for both courses, we can consider the number of possible permutations of the seating arrangements. In the first course, the first student can sit in any of the 100 seats. For the second course, there are 99 remaining seats available for the second student. Similarly, for each subsequent student, there is one less available seat. Therefore, the probability can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(no one has the same seat) = `(100/100) * (99/100) * (98/100) * ... * (1/100)`\n",

    "To find the exact probability, we need to sum up the probabilities for all possible permutations. It can be written as:\n",

    "P(no one has the same seat) = `Σ[(100!/((100-k)! * 100^k)) * (-1)^k]`\n",

    "**(b)** For a simple approximation, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle. The approximation for the probability that no one has the same seat for both courses can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(approximation) = `1 - (1/100)^100`\n",

The first passenger in line crazily decides to sit in a randomly chosen seat (with all seats equally likely). Each subsequent passenger takes his or her assigned seat if available, and otherwise sits in a random available seat.

    "ans2- The probability that the last passenger in line gets to sit in his or her assigned seat can be determined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the different possibilities for the first passenger:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the first passenger sits in his/her assigned seat, then everyone else will be able to sit in their assigned seats. In this case, the last passenger will also get to sit in his/her assigned seat.\n",

    "2. If the first passenger sits in the last passenger's seat, then the last passenger will not be able to sit in his/her assigned seat.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the first passenger sits in any other seat, it will create a chain reaction of passengers needing to choose a different seat. However, regardless of how this chain reaction unfolds, the last passenger will always have his/her assigned seat available since all the other passengers have already chosen their seats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that the last passenger gets to sit in his/her assigned seat is 1/2. This is because there are two equally likely possibilities for the first passenger (either sitting in their own seat or sitting in the last passenger's seat), and only in one of those cases will the last passenger get to sit in their assigned seat."
