What would be a reasonable distribution to use for the number of raindrops hitting a particular region measuring 5 inches2 in t minutes? Why? Using your chosen distribution, compute the probability that the region has no rain drops in a given 3 second time interval. A reasonable choice of distribution is P."

    "In this case, the average rate of raindrops is given as 20 drops per square inch per minute. The Poisson distribution is appropriate because it models the probability of a certain number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given the average rate of occurrence.\n",
